# Advent of Code 2024

This is my code for aoc2024.

This code is representative of what I
can write to solve a problem within an hour.
It is not my best highly optimized code;
it is my fastest-to-make code that works.

I may or may not get to more problems.

I use [this framework](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc) to speed up my process
and structure my project.
